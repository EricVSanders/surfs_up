# surfs_up
Bootcamp Module 09

## Overview of Project

## Tools
Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask

### Purpose

Analysis project to determine if the weather in a certain city in Hawaii will be favorable for starting and running a surf and icecream shop

## Analysis and Challenges
Need to pull temperature and precipitation records from weather recording stations and synthesize the information to determine if the weather conditions will support a surf shop operation

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Temperatures were looked at for June and December.  Favorable temperatures are seen for Oahu Hawaii and these 2 months were picked as a proxy measurement for options for running a year round surf shop there

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Although temperatures seem favorable for this possible startup seemed favorable it might be worth looking more extensively at precipitation information to see if the business might get rained out.  Additionally other locations could be looked at as well both to determine if this was the best starting location and to see if perhaps franchise options might exist in the future.
